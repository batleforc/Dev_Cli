# DevCli

The goal of this project is to provide a cli to hasten my dev process and to create interface for the tools I use.

## Eclipse Che

Eclipse che is my main env that allow me to dev in my personal time (and i love it). This project is born from [this issue](https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/22812) that follow my thinking process of loving project with source openly available.

There is also a redhat release of che that is called [DevSpace](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview).

## MonoRepo

Based on the [Rust NX](https://github.com/cammisuli/monodon/tree/main/packages/rust) template.
